Our project will mimic a banking application to the best of its ability and contain two methods of logging in: as a user or as an employee.
As the employee you will be prompted to enter your employee ID, username and password. The application will check if the employee ID, username and password
match the records being help in the database. If not, then an alert will appeaar letting the user know the inputted something incorrectly. Once the employee
is logged in, they will be able to access, view, edit, delete and add information to any user they choose. There will be a table view displaying all customers info,
upon which the employee can delete, edit or add a transaction to the selected user. They will also have an option to view a spending pie chart, displaying
the percentages of the users spending based on the category of what they spent on.
As the user you will be prompted to either log in or create an account. when creating an account, you will be prompted to fill out the following fields, when it comes
to the username and email, it will automatically generate those for you since it is based off your first and last names. once logged in, some information will display
on the homepage along with a quick transfer method and a menu. On the menu they will be able to change scenes to their choosing, such as transactions, withdrawals, 
view your cards, profile, etc. Multiple different methods will be avaiable throughout the different scenes which will update the firebase database respectively. We 
added some css styling to it giving it a bit more color and functionality.
