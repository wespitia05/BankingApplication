CSC 325 Capstone Project Proposal: Online Banking Application

Our project proposal will be an online banking applicaiton where the user will log into the system and be able to view their accounts and make any 
deposits, withdrawals or transfers needed and once all actions are completed get a log (or a receipt) of what was done. 
We will create a database with 15-20 users with their information (name, address, account number, balances, etc.) 
If the user does not have an account then they will be given the option to create one and input all the information needed and that information 
will be added to the database and stored. The code will be created using Java, our database will be created in Java using SQL, our UI will be created 
in Figma and we will host the application on Firebase.

WRSPM Analysis:

WORLD

Users have access to the internet and suitable devices (smartphones, cellphones, etc.)

Application should be able to adapt to changing economic conditions and user needs.

REQUIREMENTS

User friendly interface for easy navigation and interaction.

Accounts for different users with unique balances in each account and personal information.

User should be able to log into their account, make any deposits, withdrawals or transfers to their account.

SPECIFICATIONS

User authentication and secure data storage (database), if user does not have an account they can create one and 
the information they give will be stored in the database.

Provide a transaction history log for users to track their financial activities.

Ensure UI is accessible to everyone and doesnâ€™t look too complicated to use.

PROGRAM/MACHINE

Developing the application using Java and its frameworks, using a SQL database to store user information and Figma for UI.

We will host the application on Firebase with sufficient resources.
